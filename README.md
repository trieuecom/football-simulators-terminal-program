# ‚öΩ World Cup Tournament Simulator ‚Äì Python Project

## üéØ Project Overview

This Python project simulates a mini football (soccer) tournament inspired by World Cup structures. It includes **group stage, knockout rounds, penalty shootouts**, and outputs a detailed match result table to Excel.

The user can **interact by entering scores**, and the simulation handles draws, calculates rankings, and determines the champion through semi-finals and a final match.

This project was created as part of an Introduction to Programming course and demonstrates skills in **control flow, data structures, input validation, and file export**.

3. All teams play round-robin within each group. Top 2 teams from each group proceed.
4. Semi-finals and Final are played, including **penalty shootouts** for draws.
5. Results are saved to an Excel file at the end.
